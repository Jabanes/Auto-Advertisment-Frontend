# 🔧 Setup and Bug Fix Summary

## 🚨 Critical Issue Fixed

**Problem**: Google login wasn't working - no requests reaching the backend.

**Root Cause**: Missing `.env.local` file with `VITE_API_URL` environment variable, causing API requests to be sent to `undefined/auth/google`.

---

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. **Environment Configuration** ⚙️

**YOU MUST CREATE** a `.env.local` file in the `Auto-Advertisment-Frontend` directory with the following content:

```env
# Backend API URL
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Firebase Configuration
# Get these from your Firebase Console > Project Settings > General
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key_here
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id

# N8N Workflow URL (optional)
VITE_N8N_URL=https://your-n8n-instance.com
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Replace all the Firebase placeholder values with your actual Firebase project credentials from the Firebase Console.

### 2. **Backend Authentication Routes** 🔐

#### Fixed Response Format
- Updated `/auth/google` endpoint to return `serverToken` field (in addition to `idToken`)
- Updated `/auth/register` endpoint to return `serverToken` field
- Added `/auth/login` endpoint for email/password authentication

#### Response Structure
All auth endpoints now return:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Login successful",
  "uid": "user_id",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "serverToken": "firebase_id_token",
  "idToken": "firebase_id_token",
  "user": { /* user object */ },
  "businesses": [ /* array of businesses */ ],
  "products": [ /* array of products */ ]
}
```

---

### 3. **Backend Product Routes** 📦

#### New Endpoint: `GET /products`
- Fetches products for the authenticated user
- **Query Parameter**: `?businessId=xxx` (optional) - filters products by business
- **Usage**: 
  - `GET /products` - returns ALL products across all businesses
  - `GET /products?businessId=abc123` - returns products only for business `abc123`

**Example Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "products": [
    {
      "id": "product_id",
      "businessId": "business_id",
      "name": "Product Name",
      "price": 100,
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4. **Frontend Authentication Flow** 🔑

#### Email/Password Login
Updated to use Firebase Client SDK first, then send ID token to backend:
1. Client authenticates with Firebase using `signInWithEmailAndPassword()`
2. Gets ID token from Firebase
3. Sends ID token to backend `/auth/login`
4. Backend verifies token and returns user data

#### Google Login
Already working correctly - same flow as email login.

---

### 5. **Business Switching Logic** 🔄

#### How It Works Now:
1. User clicks on a different business in BusinessSwitcher
2. `setCurrentBusinessId` action is dispatched
3. Listener middleware automatically:
   - Fetches fresh business details for the selected business
   - Fetches products **ONLY for that business** (not all products)
4. Redux store is updated with the new business and its products
5. UI immediately reflects the change

#### Socket Integration 🔌
- Socket events (`business:created`, `business:updated`, `business:deleted`) automatically update Redux state
- Product socket events (`product:created`, `product:updated`, `product:deleted`) automatically update product list
- All changes are reflected in UI immediately

---

### 6. **Frontend Service Updates** 🛠️

#### `productService.getAll()`
- Now accepts optional `businessId` parameter
- Sends as query parameter to backend

#### `authService.emailLogin()`
- Now accepts `idToken` instead of `email` and `password`
- Sends ID token to backend for verification

## 🎯 Testing Checklist

### Before Testing
1. ✅ Create `.env.local` file with all Firebase credentials
2. ✅ Ensure backend is running on `http://localhost:3000`
3. ✅ Ensure Firebase project is configured correctly

### Test Flow
1. **Google Login**
   - [ ] Click "Sign in with Google"
   - [ ] Should see Firebase popup
   - [ ] Should successfully log in
   - [ ] Should see businesses and products loaded
   - [ ] Check browser console for logs

2. **Email Login** (if you have Firebase email/password auth enabled)
   - [ ] Enter email and password
   - [ ] Click "Sign In"
   - [ ] Should successfully log in
   - [ ] Should see businesses and products loaded

3. **Business Switching**
   - [ ] Click on business switcher icon
   - [ ] Select a different business
   - [ ] Should see loading indicator
   - [ ] Products should update to show only products for that business
   - [ ] Check browser console: should see logs about fetching business and products

4. **Create New Business**
   - [ ] Click "Add Business" in business switcher
   - [ ] Fill out business form
   - [ ] Click "Create Business"
   - [ ] Should see success message
   - [ ] New business should appear in switcher

5. **Socket Events** (Real-time Updates)
   - [ ] Open app in two browser windows
   - [ ] Create/update/delete a product in one window
   - [ ] Should see immediate update in the other window

## 🐛 Debugging Tips

### If Google Login Still Doesn't Work:

1. **Check Console Errors**:
   ```javascript
   // Open browser console (F12) and look for:
   - "API_URL is undefined"
   - CORS errors
   - Network errors
   ```

2. **Verify Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   # In frontend directory
   cat .env.local
   # Make sure VITE_API_URL is set correctly
   ```

3. **Check Backend Logs**:
   ```
   # Should see when a request comes in:
   [Auth] POST /auth/google
   [Auth] Google Sign-In: user@example.com (uid123)
   ```

4. **Network Tab**:
   - Open browser DevTools > Network tab
   - Try to log in
   - Look for request to `http://localhost:3000/auth/google`
   - Check request payload has `idToken`
   - Check response status and body

### Common Issues:

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'user')" | `.env.local` missing or VITE_API_URL not set |
| "CORS error" | Backend CORS not configured or backend not running |
| "401 Unauthorized" | Firebase token expired or invalid |
| "Firebase: Error (auth/...)" | Firebase credentials in `.env.local` are wrong |
| Products not updating on business switch | Check listener middleware logs in console |

## 📚 Architecture Summary

### Authentication Flow
```
1. User → Firebase Client SDK (login)
2. Firebase → ID Token
3. Frontend → Backend (/auth/google or /auth/login) with ID Token
4. Backend → Verifies token with Firebase Admin SDK
5. Backend → Returns user, businesses, products + serverToken
6. Frontend → Stores in Redux + localStorage (via redux-persist)
```

### Business Switching Flow
```
1. User → Clicks different business in switcher
2. Frontend → Dispatches setCurrentBusinessId(businessId)
3. Listener Middleware → Triggered automatically
4. Listener → Fetches business details (GET /businesses/:businessId)
5. Listener → Fetches products for that business (GET /products?businessId=xxx)
6. Redux Store → Updated with new business and products
7. UI → Re-renders with new data
```

### Real-time Updates (Sockets)
```
1. Frontend → Connects to backend Socket.IO with auth token
2. Backend → Authenticates socket, joins user to room "user:{uid}"
3. Any CRUD operation → Backend emits event to user's room
4. Frontend → Socket listener receives event
5. Frontend → Dispatches local Redux action to update state
6. UI → Immediately reflects change (no refetch needed)
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Create `.env.local`** with your Firebase credentials (REQUIRED)
2. **Start Backend**: `cd Auto-Advertisment-Backend && npm start`
3. **Start Frontend**: `cd Auto-Advertisment-Frontend && npm run dev`
4. **Test Login**: Try Google login and verify it works
5. **Test Business Switching**: Switch between businesses and verify products update
6. **Test Real-time**: Open two windows and create a product - should appear in both
